# dev-cooking's hyprland-dotfiles
My Hyprland Dotfiles that I stole from all around the internet and coded some parts myself/chatgpt. Most of the time the original Autor is marked in the files

Optimised from a 3 monitor desktop PC setup 

Made in Germany on Arch Linux

### Cool features

+ Every time Hyprland restarts random wallpaper for your Wallpaper directory
+ Wallpaper, Bluetooth, Network selector screen via rofi
+ Systemwide mute funktion (R-CTRL + F12)
+ Media keys work (on my Corsair Keyboard)
+ allomst all programms run native on wayland
